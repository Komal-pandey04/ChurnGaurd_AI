"""
Iranian Telecom Churn dataset (3,150 real customer records).
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (dataset 563), loaded via the
`survivalpredict` PyPI package's bundled copy of this exact dataset.
Citation: Jafari-Marandi et al. (2020), Neural Computing and Applications.

Target: churn (1 = churned by month 12; features are aggregated over
the first 9 months per the original study).

CAVEAT (do not call this "leakage-safe by construction"): the very high
AUC (~0.97-0.99 in CV) is NOT explained by one leaky column -- see
artifacts/iranian/ablation.json: removing `complains` and `status`
barely moves it. But usage features in the final months before the
label window can reflect customers who have ALREADY disengaged, so the
task is closer to "detect imminent churn" than "predict churn early".
Do not compare this dataset's AUC to Telco's as like-for-like.
